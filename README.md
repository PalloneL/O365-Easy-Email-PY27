# Python 2.7 OAuth Connection to Outlook
Follow [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth) to get the necessary parameters.

**Disclaimer: Python 2.7 is no longer supported. Only use this library if you have no way of updating to Python 3.**

[O365](https://o365.github.io/python-o365/latest/) is a free python package for Python 3.4 and later that simplifies connecting to Outlook via the MSGraph Protocol.
